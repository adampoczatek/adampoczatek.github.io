<p class="type--big">This was a busy year here at Brand View. I was lucky enough to work on some very exciting projects. However, I often <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFLTDQ4JMk">get stuck in the negatives</a> and therefore I forget about the positives. I think it's a good time to step back and look at what we have achieved.</p>

## Brand View Revamp

The *old Brand View* was designed a few years ago when 960px page width was the standard, rounded corners, strong gradients and 3D icons were cool and user experience wasn't something to worry about. Our front-end was bloated with unnecessary third-party libraries and our code was not very well organised. One of my first task in 2014 was to solve these problems.

This is how the app looked like back in 2013:

	<img src="/assets/images/public/old-brandview.jpg" class="adjust-img enhance-img" alt="Old version of Brand View" />
</a>

Design was the first thing we looked at. We focused more on the usability and user experience. We moved from static widths to fluid layouts. We adopted mobile-first approach. We implemented font icons to keep them sharp across different screen sizes and pixel ratios, and much more. 

This is the outcome:

	<img src="/assets/images/public/new-brandview.jpg" class="adjust-img enhance-img" alt="New version of Brand View" />
</a>

Front-end has been changed dramatically too. We moved from bloated JavaScript files to nicely structured Angular.js application. It wasn't easy though, I had no previous experience with this framework and it took me some time to get my head around, however, it was worth it. We can now build new features much quicker and our code is very well organised. 

I think CSS was the weakest part of our app. We were basically adding new stylesheets for every new page. There was a lot of inconsistency. We definitely needed to do something about this. We thought about using frameworks like Bootstrap or Zend but they are an overkill for what we wanted. They required a lot of customisation to make them look the way we wanted. Also, they have their own code style and naming conventions whereas I really liked [BEM methodology](https://bem.info/method/) for naming classes and [inuit.css](https://github.com/inuitcss) for the architecture so we decided to make our own framework. It's written in SASS, follows BEM and it's based on inuit.css and Inverted Triangle Architecture by Harry Roberts (demonstrated by him during [FOWD workshop](https://futureofwebdesign.com/london-2014/schedule/) in April, 2014). 

Our clients loved the new design and we received a lot of positive feedback!

## Brand View Positioning

Last year, around mid-February, I have been asked to work on a brand new product called [Brand View Positioning](http://www.brandview.com/tour/analyse-your-online-product-positioning/) which consists of 4 different reports: Reviews and Ratings, Compliance, Placement and Social. We went for an off-site meeting to discuss what needs to be done. After a few hours of brainstorming we had the spec:

<a href="/assets/images/public/positioning-spec.jpg" target="_blank">
	<img src="/assets/images/public/positioning-spec.jpg" class="adjust-img enhance-img" alt="Photos of Positioning spec" />
</a>

Believe it or not, those scribbles were enough for everyone to get started. 

Couple of months of hard work and there we are. We have delivered 4 amazing products.

### Compliance

*Compliance report automatically compares your preferred product content to that shown on retailers' sites, enabling you to instantly review how your products are being positioned and promoted. Audit the completeness, accuracy and presentation of your product information,and review the score of your products by store and identify why and how they are not complying.*

I'm particularly proud of the Compliance report. [Tony Jose](http://twitter.com/tonyjosebtsoft) and I worked really hard to make it amazing. Tony handled server-side code extremely well and thanks to him all Brand View Positioning products are lightning fast. 

We have already received some amazing feedback from our clients.

### Reviews and Ratings

*Reviews and Ratings enables you to analyse your product's reviews across multiple retailers regardless of the review and rating source. Evaluate reviews against equivalent competitor lines and identify inconsistencies across stores.*
 
### Placement

*Placement report ranks your products against competitors for key search terms by category or online store. You can use the results to optimise your search ranking to improve product visibility, consideration and conversion.*

### Social 

*Social analysis allows you to get the most out of the social media data important to your business. We track your shoppersâ€™ activity on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Google+, so you can discover the conversation that matters most to your products.*

## Brand View OnSite

Brand View is an innovating company - they aim to deliver unique products to their customers. [Brand View OnSite](http://www.brandview.com/tour/monitor-pricing-while-browsing/) is a good example of that. I've been asked to design it and Ash Clarke](https://twitter.com/ashclarke)  did a great job coding it. Lastly, [Amit Pore](https://twitter.com/Amit_Pore) handled the back-end development like a boss. This is what we have created:

## This Was a Busy Year

Besides from projects at Brand View, I also wanted to explore some new technologies. Back in January I came out with a *list of things I want to learn in 2014*. I knew I wasn't able to learn all those things but at least I could keep track of the things I'm interested in. That list was huge, yet I still managed to learn about Angular.js, TDD, JSDoc, Indexed DB, Web Workers, SASS, Grunt.js, Web Components, Sketch 3 and many more. 

To everyone at Brand View, we have built great products over the last year, you should be proud!
