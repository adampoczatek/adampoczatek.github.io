<p class="type--big">You probably know by now that paying attention to details can be very rewarding - even subtle adjustments can change the look and feel of your design.</p>

*"The details are not the details. They make the design."* I am a perfectionist and I completely agree with this quote - I even admired Google for their [41 shades of blue](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/business/01marissa.html). However, being obsessed about every single pixel isn't always a good thing, you need to find the right balance.

I used to find myself constantly improving my designs, revising each bit over and over again until I was satisfied with it and then I would ask my boss for feedback. My designs were usually signed off straight away or required couple of minor tweaks but sometimes I had to start over and that wasn't always fun, especially when deadlines were tight. Later, I realised that *done is better than perfect* - don't get me wrong, always try to achieve the best possible outcome but you also have to finish your project and the sooner the better.

## My Design Process

I love designing but I get bored if the project drags on for too long. I needed a new design process that's efficient so I've experimented with various techniques over time and this is the outcome:

* **Step 1: Research** - get as much information about the product as possible, ask many questions and write everything down - designing is all about problem solving and it's a lot easier to come up with solutions once you understand the problem.
* **Step 2: Sketch** - sketching is a fast and efficient way of getting ideas out of your head. Don't rush it - keep sketching until you can't think of any other solutions. Ask for feedback once you have some solid ideas on paper.
* **Step 3: Mock-up** - open your design tool and create some mock-ups, but don't spend too much time during this phase - you basically need a "coloured" version of your sketches. Make some prototypes if time allows. Don't worry too much about details at this stage, you just want to polish your idea.
* **Step 4: Get feedback** - now that you have something decent to show, ask your boss, friends and family what they think, find out what they don't like about the design and ask why. Always question their feedback - *"I don't like this"* isn't very helpful, ask why and what would they do to improve it.
* **Step 5: *Spit and polish*** - analyse the feedback and amend your design accordingly. Repeat step 3 and 4 if necessary but this time focus more on the details, especially with parts of the design that worked well and received good feedback. If you're the person doing the development then you may as well just jump straight to the code and apply those changes while you are building it, you'll save some time.

### Conclusion

This design process works pretty well for me but it doesn't necessarily mean it will work for you. Give it a go and you'll find out.

I'm always interested to know how other designers work so please let me know in the comments below.
