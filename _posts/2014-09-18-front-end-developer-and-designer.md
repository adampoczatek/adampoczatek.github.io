<p class="type--big">No matter whether you are a designer or a developer, if you work in the web industry you probably enjoy it as much as I do.</p>

The industry is growing tremendously fast and I think it's mainly due to the amazing community. If you're a designer you can get inspiration from beautiful shots shared on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/). If you are a developer and you have a problem with code, someone on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) will help you in no time. I particularly like the idea of open source - people are willing to share their ideas, time and effort with others to build better products. Isn't this great?

My name is Adam Poczatek and I work for [Brand View](http://www.brandview.com) as UX developer. I'll use this site to share my thoughts and ideas related with the web industry. I hope you'll enjoy it!
