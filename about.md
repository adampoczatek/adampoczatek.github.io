# About

***I've been playing around with the web for a while and I decided it's time to give something back to the community.***

I often struggle to keep up with the latest trends and I know many other developers feel the same &mdash; it seems like there is a new *thing* being released every single day and it feels overwhelming at times.

Seriously, I haven't had a chance to properly try Angular 2 and it's already on version 5.

My plan is to talk about web in general and give you advice based on my experience. I'll try to publish short and concise articles about things that I find interesting and provide you with some real-world use cases where applicable.

## My Background

Over the last couple of years I've been lucky enough to work with some great companies like [Majestic Wine](https://majestic.co.uk), [Salmon](https://www.salmon.com/en/), [Brand View](http://www.brandview.com/) and [Yell](https://www.yell.com/) to name a few, helping them deliver amazing products for their customers.

I worked on various different projects ranging from simple brochure websites that we designed, built and deployed within a day, to huge projects that took us months of hard work to make sure it was all done and dusted by the release date.

I always loved all aspects of web development &mdash; from inception meetings and brainstorming, to wireframing and design,  to development and testing and, of course, release and maintenance &mdash; that's why I always struggle to say exactly what my job title is! In most cases I was involved in all of these steps but I pirmarly focused on the *UX, UI design and front-end development*.
