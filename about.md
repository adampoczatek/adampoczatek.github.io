# About

***My name is Adam Poczatek and I'm web designer and developer from Reading, UK.***

I've been playing around with the web for a while and I decided it's time to give something back to the community.</p>

I often struggle to keep up with the latest trends and I know many other developers feel the same &mdash; it seems like there is a new *thing* being released every single day and it feels overwhelming at times.

Seriously, I haven't had a chance to properly try Angular 2 and it's already on version 5.

My plan is to publish short and concise articles about things that I find interesting and provide you with some real-world use cases.

## My Background

Over the last couple of years I've been lucky enough to work with some great companies like [Majestic Wine](https://majestic.co.uk), [Salmon](https://www.salmon.com/en/), [Brand View](http://www.brandview.com/) and [Yell](https://www.yell.com/) to name a few, helping them deliver amazing products for their customers.

I worked on various different projects ranging from simple brochure websites that we designed, built and deployed within a day, to huge projects that took us months of carefully planned worked to make sure it was all done and dusted by the release date.

I always loved all aspects of web design &mdash; from inception meetings and brainstorming, to wireframing and design,  to development and testing and, of course, release and maintenance &mdash; that's why I always struggle to say exactly what my job title is! In most cases I was involved in all of these steps but I would say my main focus was always on the *UX, UI design and front-end development*.
