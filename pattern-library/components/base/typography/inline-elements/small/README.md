[Small](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/small)
---
The HTML `<small>` element makes the text font size one size smaller (for example, from large to medium, or from small to x-small) down to the browser's minimum font size.  In HTML5, this element is repurposed to represent side-comments and small print, including copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation.
