The HTML `<strong>` element gives text strong importance, and is typically displayed in bold.

### Emphasis vs. Strong

While in HTML4, Strong simply indicated a stronger emphasis, in HTML5, the element is described as representing "strong importance for its contents." This is an important distinction to make. While Emphasis is used to change the meaning of a sentence ("I love carrots" vs. "I love carrots"), Strong is used to give portions of a sentence added importance (e.g., "Warning! This is very dangerous.") Both Strong and Emphasis can be nested to increase the relative degree of importance or stress emphasis, respectively.
