---
The HTML `<u>` element renders text with an underline, a line under the baseline of its content. In HTML5, this element represents a span of text with an unarticulated, though explicitly rendered, non-textual annotation, such as labeling the text as being a proper name in Chinese text (a Chinese proper name mark), or labeling the text as being misspelled.

### Usage notes

As with all pure styling elements, `<u>` was deprecated in HTML 4 and XHTML 1, but was then re-introduced in HTML5 with other semantics. If you want to underline text in a non-semantic manner, you should use a `<span>` element, or another semantically appropriate element, and style it with the CSS text-decoration property, with the underline value.
