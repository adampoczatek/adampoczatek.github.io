[Figure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure)
---
The HTML `<figure>` element represents self-contained content, frequently with a caption (`<figcaption>`), and is typically referenced as a single unit.

### Usage notes

* Usually a `<figure>` is an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc., that is referenced in the main flow of a document, but that can be moved to another part of the document or to an appendix without affecting the main flow.
* Being a sectioning root, the outline of the content of the `<figure>` element is excluded from the main outline of the document.
* A caption can be associated with the `<figure>` element by inserting a `<figcaption>` inside it (as the first or the last child).
